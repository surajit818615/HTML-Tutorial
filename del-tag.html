    <p>This HTML element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The ins element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p><del>This text has been deleted</del>, here is the rest of the paragraph.</p>
    <del><p>This paragraph has been deleted.</p></del>
